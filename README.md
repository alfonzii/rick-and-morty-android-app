# rick-and-morty-android-app

## TODO
* 1. Rewrite ViewHolder and Adapter on smart versions
* 2. Set searchbar filter and AsyncTask cancel at text change in searchbar
* 3. Screen rotation OFF (to get rid of AsyncTask memory leaks problems)
* 4. onDestroy() cancels AsyncTask (memory management again)
* 5. Bind data to adapter in waves - after 20 items are parsed by parsing library, not at once after everything is parsed. Run the app and don't wait until introductory data loading + LoadBar when loading
* 6. Download and show image in CharacterViewHolder

* #### Everything else (ViewHolders onClickListeners with intent to detailed description activity, better and nicer UI, all screens compatibility...)
